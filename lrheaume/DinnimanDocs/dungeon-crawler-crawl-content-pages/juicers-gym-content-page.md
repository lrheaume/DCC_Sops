"I struggle regularly with food cravings and try to use the R.A.I.N. method to combat them. Decided to try my hand at modifying that method a bit. The original R.A.I.N. method is used for things like anxiety, food cravings, and other addictive urges."

## You will not B.R.E.A.K Me!

**B:** \
Breathe Use Cyclic Sighing to reset the nervous system. This practice can help create a calming pause before the urge takes control.

**R:** \
Recognize the Urge Acknowledge the urge without judgment. Identify it as a transient feeling rather than a command you must follow.

**E:** \
Explore the Urge Take a moment to explore the urge more deeply. Ask yourself, "What am I feeling right now?" or "What triggered this?” Seek awareness of what’s fueling the urge.

**A:** \
Allow the Urge Instead of pushing the urge away, make room for it, accepting that these urges are part of life. Try framing it as a wave that rises and falls rather than something you must resist entirely.

**K:** \
Keep Going Re-engage with your next activity or routine. Sometimes, redirecting attention back to what you were doing can help you ride the urge’s wave.

"Thought this might help someone <mark style="color:purple;">(or at least spread awareness of the real R.A.I.N. method!).</mark> Also highly recommend <mark style="color:orange;">Cyclic Sighing</mark> as an individual practice. Scientists from Stanford found that it is one of the most effective methods of releasing stress. Apologies for the length here!"

  This is the proving ground for my testing and technical documentation. If I
  can explain it in the layman's term, then I will be convinced I can understand
  the content therein.

# ðŸ¦‹ Table of contents, or how to use this resource

I am an avid supporter of the free use of knowledge, tools and techniques. I do not believe innovation should be behind a paywall. The future of our work as humans lie in the training and sharing of our hard won skills to those who will follow us down the paths we've carved out for them. I am attempting to open source for idiots, in accessible, easy to consume and reference terminology and formats. I welcome all feedback to make this project the best I can.&#x20;



Thank you for joining me on the Journey.&#x20;
